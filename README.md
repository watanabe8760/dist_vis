# Probability Distribution Visualization

https://teru.shinyapps.io/dist_vis/

 How does Beta distribution look like when $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 2$? This kind of questions might become your concern when you develop a particularly designed statistical model, like Bayesian hierarchical model. In such a case it would be nice to have an application which visualizes major probability distributions in a snap.

### Available Distributions

#### Continuous
- Normal
- Uniform
- Beta
- Gamma
- Exponential
- Chi-squared

#### Discrete
- Uniform
- Binomial
- Poisson
- Geometric

### To be improved
- [ ] Add pdf/pmf formulas
- [ ] Add E[x] formulas and values
- [ ] Add Var(x) formulas and values
- [ ] Add quantile information
